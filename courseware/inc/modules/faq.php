                <div class="crs_faq_text">ShareTopic is a Plastipak module to create and share Topics for training purposes. This online module stands out because it is easy to work with, enabling associates to co-train each other on important topics. Topics are similar to online courses, but you don't have to take an exam to pass a test and you won't receive a certificate, either. Basically, this platform is used to share information, learn and obtain more experience in our workplace.</div>
